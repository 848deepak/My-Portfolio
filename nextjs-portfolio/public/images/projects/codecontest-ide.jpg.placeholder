This is a placeholder for the CodeContest-IDE project image.

For the actual implementation, you should:
1. Create or obtain a screenshot of the CodeContest-IDE application
2. Resize it to approximately 400x240 pixels
3. Save it as codecontest-ide.jpg in this directory
4. The image should show the IDE interface with the code editor, contest management features, or dashboard

The image should highlight:
- Monaco Editor interface
- Contest management system
- Modern UI with dark theme
- Code execution capabilities
- Admin dashboard features
